    "# Introduction to constrained multi-objective management optimization (under uncertainty)\n",
    "\n",
    "### yeah, its getting deep!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the two PESTPP-OPT notebooks ([freyberg opt 1](../part2_08_opt/freyberg_opt_1.ipynb) and [freyberg opt 2](../part2_08_opt/freyberg_opt_2.ipynb)), we introduced the concept of constrained management optimization under uncertainty.  We saw standard risk-neutral optimization and then piled on the learning and concepts with the idea of chances, chance constraints, risk/reliability, and stacks.  So if you are reading this notebook, we assume that you are familiar with these concepts and terminology by now. If not, we recommend you go through the PESTPP-OPT notebooks first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, so now let's talk about the nature of constraints and _multiple_ objective functions.  In the Freyberg example, we have been treating the sw-gw exchange flux and the aggregate groundwater extraction rate for each stress period as a \"hard\" inequality constraint (thou shall not violate!). However, in real-world decision-making settings, although there may be a general stakeholder preference to avoid unwanted outcomes,  the exact nature of that avoidance is often not known. \"Sure we want to keep some groundwater flowing into the surface-water system but we also want have plenty of water to drink\". As with many things in the messy real-world, this is all very imprecise and mucky...so how can we, science nerds, deal with this messiness?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, one way is to use so-called \"multi-objective\" optimization. Here the goal is to map the trade-off between competing objectives. We move away from giving the \"unique\" optimal solution (that respects our constraints and risk-stance). Instead, we provide the range of solutions (that respect the constraints), and their corresponding effects on the competing objectives. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, this kind of trade-off mapping is very (very (_very!_)) computationally expensive because, in most cases, we have to resort to \"global\" evolutionary-type algorithms.  Note that \"multi-objective\" doesn't mean go crazy with objectives.  Five or six is probably the most that be used for algorithmic reasons.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> ### WARNING! \n",
    "Running this notebook can take a looong time. You may wish to quickly read through, (__IMPORTANT!__) set the number of PESTPP-MOU worker agents adequate for your machine, and then let MOU do its business for a few hours (or even over-night). Alternatively, you can read through the notebook on the repository GitHub page without needing to run anything. That being said, going through the pain of having to listen to your computer groan as it runs the model a gazillion times is a powerful lesson into the benefits of simple model design. (_Recall that the Freyberg model takes seconds to run; imagine doing this with a model that takes 1 minute or...dare I say it...several minutes! #somuchpain_)\n",

Group names that start with “less_than” are identified as less-than constraints/minimization objectives; group names that start with “greater_than” are identified as greater-than constraints/maximization objectives. The distinction between constraints and objectives is made via the mou_objectives argument. Any observation and prior information equation names (not group names) passed via MOU_OBJECTIVES are treated as objectives, not constraints. While it may seem tempting to make all constraints objectives, in practice, the algorithm elements encoded in PESTPP-MOU can tolerate up to 5 objectives, and, more realistically, 2-3 objectives may be a better choice.\n",

Effectively, we started in a relatively \"small\" area of decision variable space,  which we knew was likely to be feasible. Then, PESTPP-MOU went off and explored a larger area.\n",
