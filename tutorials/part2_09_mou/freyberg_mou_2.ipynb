    "# When worlds collide even more: constrainted multi-objective optimization under uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous optimization notebook ([\"freyberg_mou_1](../part2_09_mou/freyberg_mou_1.ipynb)), we saw how we can use PESTPP-MOU to do some pretty killer decision support with multi-objective optimization.  It was awesome...Now, lets see how stacks, risk, and reliability come into play here.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally the concept is the same as with chance constraints that we saw in the second PESTPP-OPT notebook.  However, PESTPP-MOU extends the \"chance\" concept to also include objectives derived from model outputs. Like model-based constraints and predictions/forecasts, these objectives are also subject to uncertainty, in as much as these objectives depend on model inputs (i.e. parameters) that are uncertain.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But things get complicated now.  In PESTPP-OPT, we had a single \"solution\" (i.e. set of decision variables) but PESTPP-MOU works with populations of individual decision variable vectors.  Does this mean that we need to evaluate the stack at each individual?! And what about each generation?!  OMG - that is an insane number of runs!  Luckily PESTPP-MOU lets you \"reuse\" the stack evaluation results across individuals and across generations.  The former is controlled by the \"opt_chance_points\" argument, while the latter is controlled by \"opt_recalc_chance_every\" argument.  Again, the choice for how to evaluate chances must be a tradeoff between computational burden and coupling expectations (and how that coupling might effect the pareto-optimal set).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, so how is this sharing accomplished?  Well, its a matter of finding the \"nearest\" point in decision variable space where the stack has been evaluated for each individual that needs chance info, and then differencing the mean value of the constraint/objective stack distribution and the corresponding value for the constraint/objective value at the individual.  That is just book-keeping - easy as!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### But, wait! there is more.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if the risk/reliability value for decision makers is not known and therefore cannot be provided as an input to PESTPP-MOU?  Or what if you aren't sure if a given risk/reliability value will cause infeasibility?  What can we do about this?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, what if we treat risk as just another objective that we want to maximize (that is prefer more risk averse solutions)?.  In this case, PESTPP-MOU will simply look for pareto-optimal combinations of the objectives (which also includes varying risk values).  WAT?!  Yeah, that's right!  You can treat risk as an objective and then the results of a PESTPP-MOU run will include a range of risk stances that can be filters/sliced/diced however you want. BOOM!\n"
